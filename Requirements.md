# Requirements for PHP Random Number Generator Application

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a web application built using PHP. The application will generate random numbers within a specific range and display them. It will also feature an administrative section allowing a designated admin user to view and manipulate the sequence of upcoming random numbers.

## 2. User Roles

* **Regular User:** Can view the generated random numbers.
* **Administrator:** Can log in to a special section to view generated numbers, predict the next sequence of numbers, and edit that sequence.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Random Number Generation

* The application must generate random integers.
* The range for generated numbers must be between 1 and 200 (inclusive).

### 3.2. User Interface (Public View)

* The main page should display the random numbers that have been generated during the current session.
* There should be a mechanism (e.g., a button) for the user to trigger the generation of a *new* random number.
* Each newly generated number should be added to the displayed list of generated numbers.

### 3.3. Admin Login

* There must be a specific login page or mechanism for the administrator (e.g., accessible via `/admin/login.php` or similar).
* The login system must use the following **fixed** credentials:
    * **Username:** `harsh`
    * **Password:** `harshoswal711`
* **Security Constraint:** Per requirements, **no password hashing** is to be implemented. The password will be checked against the plain text value.
* Successful login should redirect the admin to the Admin Dashboard.
* Failed login attempts should display an appropriate error message.

### 3.4. Admin Dashboard

* Accessible only after successful admin login.
* **Display Generated Numbers:** Must show the list of all numbers generated during the current session (similar or identical to the public view).
* **Display Next Numbers:** Must display the *next 5 numbers* that are scheduled to be generated, in their intended sequence.
    * If no sequence has been manually set by the admin, this section should predictively show the next 5 numbers the standard random generation logic *would* produce (or simply generate 5 placeholder random numbers if true prediction isn't feasible without more complex state management).
* **Edit Next Numbers:** Must provide an interface (e.g., 5 input fields) allowing the admin to **edit** the sequence of the next 5 numbers.
    * The admin should be able to input specific numbers (within the 1-200 range) for each of the next 5 slots.
    * There must be a way to save these edited numbers.
    * Input validation should ensure only numbers between 1 and 200 are accepted.

### 3.5. Generation Logic with Admin Override

* When a new number generation is triggered (by a regular user):
    1.  The system must first check if there is an admin-defined number sequence available.
    2.  If an admin-defined sequence exists and has numbers remaining:
        * The *next* number from the admin's sequence must be used as the "generated" number.
        * This number should be removed from the admin's sequence queue.
    3.  If no admin-defined sequence exists or the sequence is empty:
        * A standard random number between 1 and 200 should be generated.
* The admin's edited sequence takes precedence over standard random generation.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Technology:** The application must be built using PHP.
* **User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX):**
    * The UI must be built using the **Bootstrap** framework (latest stable version recommended, e.g., Bootstrap 5+).
    * The design must follow a **mobile-first** approach, ensuring responsiveness and optimal viewing on devices of all sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
    * The overall aesthetic should be **modern, clean, and visually appealing** ("extremely beautiful").
* **Persistence:**
    * **No Database:** The application **must not** use a database for storing generated numbers, admin credentials, or the next number sequence.
    * **State Management:** Application state (list of generated numbers, admin login status, next number sequence) must be managed using PHP sessions or potentially temporary files. Data will likely be lost when the user session ends or the server restarts.
* **Security:**
    * Admin credentials are fixed and stored/checked in plain text. **This is a significant security risk and is implemented only as explicitly requested.**
    * No specific requirements for protection against other web vulnerabilities (like XSS, CSRF) were given, but basic precautions using Bootstrap components and standard PHP practices are advisable.
* **Usability:** The interface should be simple and intuitive for both regular users and the administrator, leveraging standard Bootstrap components for familiar interactions.

## 5. Exclusions

* User registration or multiple user accounts.
* Password recovery mechanism.
* Database integration.
* Password hashing or salting.
* Long-term persistence of generated numbers across sessions or server restarts.
* Advanced security features beyond basic input validation.
* Custom CSS frameworks or extensive custom CSS beyond Bootstrap overrides/customizations.
